            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Ayomide Aduroja. I am a Nigerian and a student at altschool, my alt school ID is ALT/SOE/023/3245. I am a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University, where I graduated with a degree in German Language. I am currently studying
                Tourism and Hospitality management at the University of Kajaani, Finland. I decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering to widen my knowledge and to add more to my area of expertise
                and I believe this decision will turn out to be a good one in the next couple of months. It has not been an easy journey here in alt school but I believe with time, everything will fall in place. I speak 5 languages; Yoruba, English,
                German all fluently, while French and FInnish are still at the basic level.

                visiting new places. I am sapiosexual and I love engaging in witty coversations. I am a hardcore Chelsea fan and a die hard football 
                lover. Outside learning and working, I love to relax listening to music and playing video games.

            <h2>Goals and aspiration</h2>
            <p>My goal and aspiration in life is to be succesful and comfortable. I want a life of comfort without pressure. My ultimate goal is to
                visit as much as 12 european countries before I clock 30. My personal aspiration in life is to always look back in time and see myself
                doing better than yesterday, every single day of my life.
